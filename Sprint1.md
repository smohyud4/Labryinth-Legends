Sprint 1 Completion

Bhumir Patel: 
  In charge of creating the maze algorithm and building maze rooms.
  I was able to create a maze algorithm that printed out each cell and its neighbors. This will make it easier when we have to add a room to each cell. Let's say we have a cell that has two neighbors, we can attach a room that has     two doors. Furthermore, I added sprites for each room type there can be 1 door, 2 doors, 3 doors, or 4 doors.
