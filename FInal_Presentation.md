### Section 1: Introduction
* Overview
    * A 2D dungeon game that includes a randomly generated maze, enemies, and a final boss.
    * The motivation for the project is to create a simple yet entertaining game. Additionally, we plan to use the game development process as an educational opportunity for learning how to use tools such as Unity and C#.
    * It is a novel game. It would provide mobile gamers with a unique option for a game to play within this genre.
    * While at first, our idea was to develop this game for multiple devices such as PC and mobile, We faced a challenge in designing the game for mobile. The challenge that arose was the controller for the mobile gameplay would be completely different which would and the screen would be crowded with buttons.
    * We were able to accomplish our original idea of creating a maze, enemies, and a final boss. Additionally, we had a great learning opportunity when it came to using GitHub with Unity and developing components, prefabs, and scriptable objects.

### Section 2: Customer Value
* Customer Needs
    * The primary customers are gamers.
    * The customer wants a puzzle-based fighting game.
    * There is an ever-evolving need for a new or unique game that can provide the player with an enjoyable recreational experience.
* Proposed Solution
    * Players will enjoy engaging gameplay mechanics, such as puzzle-solving, combat encounters, and character progression, keeping them hooked and entertained throughout their gaming experience.
* Measures of Success
    * Some ways weâ€™ll know that the customer is satisfied is through playtime, customer rating, and social media presence.
* Result/Changes
    * While the game is fully functional, there is still a lot of work we can put into it to make it a polished game that many people will be able to enjoy. 

### Section 3: Technology
* Unity Engine

The Unity Engine will be the primary technology that we use due to the robust amount of pre-existing software tools that it has and the supportive community with plenty of documentation allowing for a more streamlined development process.

* Testing will be determined by playing through and ensuring all features are working as they should.
### Section 3.5: Technology Delivered
* What the software will do - The software is a playable game targeted towards mobile devices that will let the player enjoy an endless and continuously progressing experience.
* Main Components - The most critical component is the game engine. Following in importance are the scripts that we write, assets that are either outsourced or custom-created, and the scenes that are created with those assets.
* Minimal System - We only need a simple maze generator with basic move and attack functionality.
* Testing - The Unity Engine allows developers to play their game as they develop it. It allows for playing on the computer that the game engine is installed on. We used this to test the game as we made it for bugs and to see if the new scripts and components worked as intended.

### Section 4: Team
* Skills
    * We have 2 team members who have built something similar. Only one team member has used Unity for development, the rest of us are new to the technology. There are 4 of us who are new to C#.
* Roles
    * Grady: Project Leader
        * Grady was the project leader since he had the most experience with Unity. He would go through everyone's progress to help out and make suggestions. Additionally, he created the inventory system, the final boss, and put everyone's components together.
    * Bhumir: Maze Generation and Room Creation
        * Bhumir was in charge of creating a different maze each time it loaded up so that no maze was the same. Additionally, he created the playable rooms.
    * Brian: Enemy Creation and Attack
        * Brian was in charge of creating the enemy animations, and attacks. Furthermore, he created a script that would target the player if he got close.
    * Sully: Music and UI
        * Sully was in charge of the music that would be played on the main menu and during gameplay. Additionally, he was in charge of creating different menus such as the main menu and pause menu. Finally, he also created the health bar UI for the player and the final boss.
    * Tanner: Player Creation and Movement
        * Tanner was in charge of creating the main player. He was able to accomplish the animation, attack, and different actions for different buttons. For example, he was able to toggle if the player had a sword and shield if "C" was pressed, this allowed the player to move faster or slower depending on the toggle.
    * Role Changes:
        * While these roles were pretty much static, we did change to help out each other if they needed something first to be built. 

### Section 5: Project Management
  * Did we meet the project goal?
      * Sadly we didn't meet all the project goals we initially had. However, we were able to finish the minimal system and added some features to it as well.
  * Reasons:
      * One reason we didn't meet the goal was we were learning a new technology, Unity, that most of us just didn't know. Additionally, we had trouble with GitHub and unity files with .unity. Since these files were specially made for Unity, there were a bunch of merge errors and fatal git pushes and pulls.
        
### Section 6: Reflection
  * Project Pros and Cons:
      * Pros:
          * Meeting every friday and some wednesdays to discuss issues and progess.
          * Everyone was meeting deadlines and working on what they said they were going to do. Sometimes it would be the same day as the meeting to not delay progress.
          * Everyone sticked with their roles and learned different things from youtube videos on their own.
          * Testing on PC went as well as it can go. After any new feature was implemented, we tested it out by just playing the game to see if its working as intented.
      * Cons:
          * Unity integration with github. Lots of merge errors with *.unity files.
          * How to structure the project. At first we tries to do branches but that didn't go well since everyone relied on each others work to add features.
          * Testing for mobile didn't go as planned since it had different controlls. 

  * Final Thoughts:
      * Success or Failure
          * We as a group believe that this project from the begining would be hard, but we would work on it and hop through the hurdles. As the semster comes to an end, we believed we did our best to learn and change things as we learned how to operate Unity. Therefore, we beleived that this project was a success since we our modivation was to create a game and learn Unity and C#. We are glad to say that exactly what we did!
