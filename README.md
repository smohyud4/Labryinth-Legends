### Section 1: Customer Value
* Customer Needs
    * The primary customers are gamers.
    * The customer wants a puzzle-based fighting game.
    * There is an ever-evolving need for a new or unique game that can provide the player with an enjoyable recreational experience.
* Proposed Solution
    * Players will enjoy engaging gameplay mechanics, such as puzzle-solving, combat encounters, and character progression, keeping them hooked and entertained throughout their gaming experience.
* Measures of Success
    * Some ways weâ€™ll know that the customer is satisfied is through playtime, customer rating, and social media presence. 

### Section 2: Proposed Solution & Technology
* A game 
* Unity Engine

The Unity Engine will be the primary technology that we use due to the robust amount of pre-existing software tools that it has and the supportive community with plenty of documentation allowing for a more streamlined development process.

* Testing will be determined by playing through and making sure all features are working as they should.
### Section 2.5: Technology Delivered
* What the software will do - The software is a playable game targeted towards mobile devices that will let the player enjoy an endless and continuously progressing experience.
* Main Components - The most critical component is the game engine. Following in importance is the scripts that we write, assets that are either out-sourced or custom-created, and the scenes that are created with those assets.
* Minimal System - The minimum system we need is a simple maze generator with basic move and attack functionality. The exact mechanics that are critical to the project are listed in the Descoping section.
* Possible Enhancements - Once the minimum system has been implemented, more complex mechanics and features could be added to make the game more robust and enjoyable. Some possible ideas are listed below.
     * Enemy Wave Mode - At the end of a level, rather than having a single boss, we could have a set number of waves of enemys generated around the player.
     * Levels and Stats - Give the player the ability to level up and choose stats so that they can tailor their character to their play style
     * Items and Weapons - The more items and weapons the player has available to them, the more play styles are available to the player which will add to the replayability and enjoyment of the game.
     * More Scenes and Altered Maze Generation - To allow for a more interesting game we can produce several different styles of mazes and different level design types.
* Testing - The Unity Engine allows for developers to play their game as they develop it. It allows for playing on the computer that the game engine is installed on and test on mobile devices connected to the computer. It also allows Android phones to directly download the game from the computer. We can use this to test the game as we make it and allow for non-team members to beta test the game.
### Section 3: Team
* Skills
    * We have 2 team members who have built something similar. Only one team member has used Unity for development, the rest of us are new to the technology. There are 4 of us who are new to C#.
* Roles
    * All roles will be shared

### Section 4: Project Management
* Schedule
    * The completion is feasible. There will always be more features that can be added to the game, however, developing a game with sufficient features and functionality for a complete user experience within a semester is certainly attainable. 
    * We will be meeting at 10:20 AM online, every Friday.
    * Tentative Schedule:
        * 2/16 - Familiarized with Unity, start developing foundations of the game
        * 2/23 - Start developing enemies and weapons
        * 3/1 - Make sure player interactions are correct
        * Attempt to continue adding features
### Section 5: Descoping
The full game is planned to have a large number of game mechanics and levels. However, we will start working on the core mechanics before the less critical one's. This will allow us to both test the game much sooner and release a playable version of the game before all intended mechanics have been added. Video games lend themselves to updates so even if some mechanics and levels are not implemented within the time frame, it will still be playable and be useful for the intended purpose. The most important and minimum required mechanics are listed below.
   * User Controls - The ability for a player to move around, pick up items, open inventory, and attack.
   * Maze Generation - Generating the random maze for the player to traverse and generate loot and enemies.
   * Combat Mechanics - The ability for the player to enter into combat with the spawned enemies and for the enemies to attack the player.
### Section 6: Constraints
* Unity Engine - Unity Engine allows the users a personal license which will let us make a game and upload it to app stores free of charge unless a certain amount of income from the game is reached.
* Data Collection - There will be no data collection from the players. All information, personal or otherwise, will be stored on their local machine.
