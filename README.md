### Section 1: Introduction
* Overview
    * A 2D dungeon game that includes, mazes, bosses, and possibly an enemy wave-based mode
    * The motivation for the project is to create a simple yet entertaining game. Additionally, we plan to use the game development process as an educational opportunity for learning how to use tools such as Unity and C#.
    * It is a novel game. It would provide mobile gamers with a unique option for a game to play within this genre.  
    * Background:
        * Brian - Only C++ and some python, only for courses
        * David - C++, limited java experience 
        * James - C++, C#, Java, Unity Engine, frontend and backend
        * Bhumir - C++, python, and little unity experience
        * Sulaiman - Some C++ game development experience, as well as frontend development

### Section 2: Customer Value
* Customer Needs
    * The primary customers are gamers.
    * The customer wants a puzzle based fighting game.
    * There is an ever evolving need for a new or unique game that can provide the player with an enjoyable recreational experience.
* Proposed Solution
    * Players will enjoy engaging gameplay mechanics, such as puzzle-solving, combat encounters, and character progression, keeping them hooked and entertained throughout their gaming experience.
* Measures of Success
    * Some ways weâ€™ll know that the customer is satisfied is through playtime, customer rating, and social media presence. 

### Section 3: Proposed Solution & Technology
* A game 
* Unity Engine

The Unity Engine will be the primary technology that we use due to the robust amount of pre-existing software tools that it has and the supportive community with plenty of documentation allowing for a more streamlined development process.

* Testing will be determined by playing through and making sure all features are working as they should.

### Section 4: Team
* Skills
    * We have 2 team members who have built something similar. Only one team member has used Unity for development, the rest of us are new to the technology. There are 4 of us who are new to C#.
* Roles
    * All roles will be shared

### Section 5: Project Management
* Schedule
    * The completion is feasible. There will always be more features that can be added to the game, however, developing a game with sufficient features and functionality for a complete user experience within a semester is certainly attainable. 
    * We will be meeting at 10:20AM online, every Friday.
    * Tentative Schedule:
        * 2/16 - Familiarized with Unity, start developing foundations of game
        * 2/23 - Start developing enemies and weapons
        * 3/1 - Make sure player interactions are correct
        * Attempt to continue adding features
